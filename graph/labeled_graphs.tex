The number of labeled graphs with $n$ vertices is equal to: $G_n = 2^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$.

The number of connected graphs is: $C_n = G_n - \frac{1}{n} \sum \limits_{k=1}^{n-1} k \binom{n}{k} C_k G_{n-k}$.

$D[i][j]$ - the number of labeled graphs with $i$ vertices and $j$ components: $D[n][k] = \sum \limits_{s=1}^{n} \binom{n-1}{s-1} C_s D[n-s][k-1]$.

The number of labeled trees with $n$ vertices: $T_n = n^{n-2}$.

The number of labeled forests with $n$ vertices and $k$ components: $F_{n,k} = k \cdot n^{n-k-1}$.

The number of ways to complete a forest with components of sizes $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k$ into a tree: $\prod \limits_{i=1}^k a_i \cdot \left(\sum \limits_{i=1}^k a_i \right)^{k-2}$
