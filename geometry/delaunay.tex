The Delaunay triangulation maximizes the minimum angle among all possible triangulations.

The Minimum Euclidean spanning tree of a point set is a subset of edges of its' Delaunay triangulation.

The Voronoi diagram of a set of points is dual to its Delaunay triangulation. Dual graph of a plane graph $G$ is a graph that has a vertex for each face of $G$. The dual graph has an edge for each pair of faces in $G$ that are separated from each other by an edge.
